Rollercoaster Ticket Billing System

This Python program determines whether a user can ride a rollercoaster based on their height and calculates the total ticket cost based on age and optional photo purchase.

📌 Program Features

Checks height eligibility for the rollercoaster

Calculates ticket price based on age group

Allows users to add a photo for an extra fee

Displays the final bill

🧠 How It Works

The program welcomes the user.

It asks for the user’s height (in cm).

If the height is 120 cm or more, the user can ride.

The program then asks for the user’s age and assigns a ticket price:

Child (≤ 12 years) → $5

Youth (≤ 18 years) → $7

Adult (> 18 years) → $12

The user is asked if they want a photo taken:

If yes (y), $3 is added to the bill.

The program prints the final total amount.

If the user is below 120 cm, they are not allowed to ride.
